             - keep track of statistics (how many times each player wins)
             - hide the "Player X Go!" on startup; show it only while game is playing
             - when a winner is determined, the player information still swaps: would be nice if it didn't (I would
             automatically hide those things before the game starts and when it ends (Week 3))
             - change the font colour of the winning combination (don't forget to change it back when the game is reset)
